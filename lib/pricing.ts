/**
 * Master pricing/membership data — the single source of truth for Section 06.
 *
 * PURE FRONTEND: there is no CMS, database, API or backend pricing source.
 * Everything the pricing register renders is authored here; the component in
 * components/sections/Membership.tsx consumes this verbatim and never hardcodes
 * a price, name, duration, label or CTA. To re-price the site for a real gym,
 * edit ONLY this file.
 *
 * Do not add discounts, savings, "best value" / "most popular" tags, urgency,
 * scarcity or guarantees — none of those exist in this contract by design.
 *
 * PRICE STATUS
 *   "exact"   -> render the numeric `price`, INR-formatted.
 *   "contact" -> render `contactLabel` ("Consult management") instead of an
 *                amount; `price` may be omitted.
 *   "hidden"  -> the entry does not render publicly at all.
 * Change a single plan's `priceStatus` to move it between these states without
 * touching the component.

/**
 * BE STRONG FITNESS CLUB GYM pricing/membership data — Section 06.
 *
 * TEMPLATE DEMO PRICING (prospect-demo rules, Cases C/E):
 *
 * docs/Gym-research.md PRICING: Be Strong Fitness Club Gym does not publish
 * pricing publicly (`publishes_pricing_publicly: false`) and every plan —
 * daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, half-year, annual, special training,
 * joining fee — is `NOT_FOUND` with `value: null`. No researched price
 * exists, so EVERY amount below is the existing template demonstration
 * price and is NOT a verified Be Strong Fitness Club Gym price. Owner must
 * supply real prices before final-client production.
 *
 * No "Consult management" state was introduced; all plans stay
 * `priceStatus: "exact"`. The festival offer engine
 * (lib/festival-offers.ts) references the `half-year` and `annual` plan IDs
 * below — do not rename those IDs. No second pricing or offer calculation
 * exists; the engine derives every discounted amount from these prices.
